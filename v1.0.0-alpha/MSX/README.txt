To go to the BASIC from the MSX-DOS you must execute the BASIC command.

To go to MSX-DOS from BASIC, CALL SYSTEM must be executed.

NOTES:

In BASIC use the "CTRL + STOP" keys to stop the execution of a program. The MSX STOP key is mapped to the END key of the PC.

To change the video mode by switching between 50HZ and 60HZ, and thus play at correct speed to PAL games, through the VGA output, you can use the program "DISPLAY.COM", which is to download in this thread (https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/software/dos-tool-to-switch-from-50-to-60hz).
