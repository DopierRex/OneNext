Papilio Duo Issues:

- Arduino Held in Reset: NuLA Games trigger JTAG boundary scan.
- Arduino Running Flasher: User LED conflicts with Joy1 Up (p134).
- Arduino Running Hacked Flasher (LED/JTAG disabled): Works fine.

Current testing issues: 2022/05/11 ca5ca6b8

- MODE7 3C00 works in Master Mode (it shouldn't)
- SAA5050 Parrot of Doom eye bug test case failure (bug not implemented)
- SAA5050 Clear Hold 2/3 test case failure
- MC6845 Chris Evans rvi-working test fails                                [ now fixed ]
- MC6845 Chris Evans raster-c test palette change 1 char late              [ now just 1px early ]
- MC6845 Chris Evans raster-c test pulsing suggest blanking difference     [ same on beeb ]
- MC6845 Tom Seddon Cursor size test fails                                 [ now fixed ]
- MC6845 Tom Seddon Light Pen interrupt test slightly early                [ now fixed ]
- MC6845 Tom Seddon mode7-disen  test looks different
