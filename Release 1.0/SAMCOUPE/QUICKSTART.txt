Disk image support
------------------
Only MGT and CPM format is supported. There is no support for copy protected disks with odd formats at present, unless 
cracked versions.  

To convert disks use Simon Owen's excellent SAMdisk utility available here: https://simonowen.com/samdisk/

2nd drive support
-----------------
SAMDOS stores the drive configuration along with the DOS on the disk and inherits the settings from the dos it loads.
Since not all SAMs had a 2nd drive, then if you boot a SAMDOS that was saved on a machine with only 1 drive, when you
try to DIR 2, then you will receive the message: "103 No such drive, 0:1".  To get around this, and to enable the
second drive after booting SAMDOS, you can enable the drive with the simple command:
- POKE DVAR 2, 208

If you resave the SAMDOS onto the disk, then it will save the setting and next time you boot that disk it will remember
that you had 2 drives configured.  This shouldn't affect PRODOS (CPM).
