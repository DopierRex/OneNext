	Driver for FAT16 ver 0.12
	-------------------------


1. About the driver FAT16

   This driver allows MSX-DOS 2 to manage disks formatted in FAT16.
   (MSX-DOS 2 ver2.2x/ver2.3x compatible)
 
   The FAT16 system supports disks or partitions up to 2GB.
   Utilities specific to your disk interface will be needed to format
   and mount disks or partitions in FAT16.

   - For those of the ATA-IDE or CF interface, go to the Sunrise website.
   - For Mega-SCSI, use command CP16. COM.
   

2. Use

   Enter the following command under MSX-DOS 2 to run FAT16.COM.

    FAT16 [/R][/D][/H]

   Parameters:
 	
	/R - Remove the FAT16 driver.
	     Make a copy of the DOS2 kernel from the Master Slot Disk-ROM.
	/D - Display the type of FAT used for each disk.
	      FAT12 = FAT on 12 bits
	      FAT16 = FAT on 16 bits
	/H - Display the help.
   
   The FAT16 driver is installed when no parameter is specified.	     

   Warning : Before installing/removing the FAT16 driver, please absolutely
             close the open files (more than 4 files handled) with the File
             Interface Block because the FAT16 driver extends internally
             the FIB.

3. About COMMAND2.COM command

  -  DIR command does not correctly display the free memory of FAT16 disks.
     This is caused by a COMMAND2.COM routine that calculates only 16 bits.
     PATCHCOM.COM is used to apply a patch to COMMAND2.COM so that the
     calculation is done on 24 bits.
     
    Application of the patch:
    Copy the PATCHCOM.COM and COMMAND2.COM files to a folder, open that
    folder and enter the following command under MSX-DOS2.
    	
	>PATCHCOM 

    These patches can be applied on the COMMAND2.COM v2.20, v2.30 or v2.31.
    Then copy the patched COMMAND2.COM to the root of the Boot Disk and
    restart the MSX.
    
    There is another command called COMPATCH.COM to apply this patch until
    v2.41 (versions made by TNI).
        
    These patches are no longer needed for the following versions.


4. How to use MultiMente (by MOGU)

   For MM to correctly display the folders of a FAT16 partition, please
   apply one of the following patches.
   
   - MMPATCH.COM is used to apply the patch to MM v2.07A.
   - MMKPATCH.COM is used to apply the patch to MM v2.07K.


5. Error messages

  - option error
	There is a parameter error.

  - unknown kernel
	The kernel of MSX-DOS 2 is not recognized but it is compatible
	v2.2x and v2.3x. Please contact me if this error occurs.


6. MSX-DOS 2 internal management when the FAT16 driver is installed

  - The sectors of a FAT12 or FAT16 is managed on 24 bits and that of the
    FAT on 16 bits.
   
  - The type of file system is written in the boot sector. This one is read
    and if the string 'FAT16' is found, the disk will be managed in FAT16.
    The FAT will be written and read on 16 bits and the bits 16~22 of the
    sector number will have to be specified in the C register when calling
    to DSKIO.

    Bits 16~23 of the sector number of DOS functions 2Fh and 30h are reset,
    therefore a direct access to the sectors is possible only between
    0 and FFFFh.
    
  - If there is no string 'FAT16' in the boot sector, the disk will be managed
    in FAT12. The FAT will be written and read on 12 bits, the identifier of
    the media will be specified to the C register when calling DSKIO.
   
  - The File Interface Block in the data segment takes up to 2 bytes for
    FAT12 and FAT16. The first cluster numbers of a file, the cluster numbers
    of the folders, and other information are saved in the file descriptor
    block (File Interface Block).
    
    The FAT16 driver extends the FIB to save bits 16~ 3 of the sector number
    of the files. Using FIB is the safest way to access FAT16.
     
  - To obtain parameters with the function 31h, the data storage location
    is slightly different on a FAT16 disk.
  
    The two bytes at DE+9 that normally contain the number of logical
    sectors will allways contain 00.
    As for the number of logical sectors, it will be on the 3 bytes at DE+18.
    00 will mean 100h for the number of sectors per FAT at DE+12.


7. Other

  - FAT16 driver is a program under development.
    I decline all responsibility for any data destruction that may occur
    during the use of the driver. Please work in FAT16 only with copies of
    your data and software.
    
  - The MSX-DOS2 is a very good OS but it can read and write only on some of
    the FAT16 disks. You have to be very careful in writing because only the
    12 bits are managed and this can corrupt the data.
    
  - To speed up the DIR command, I used a dedicated buffer for the function 1Bh.
    This buffer is in 16K pages allocated in the main Memory Mapper. If the
    free pages are insufficient, the buffer will be created on the disk and the
    DIR command will become slow. (When RAM is insufficient, no error message
    is displayed)
    
  - The following functions of DOS2 are disabled when using the FAT16 driver.
    (Returns the error code DCh if they are used.)
    You must remove the FAT16 driver to use them.

	67h - Formatting a floppy disk (You can use FFORMAT.COM by Ryouga)
	68h - Create or delete the RAM-disk *

    (*) If the RAM-disk is created before installing the FAT16 driver, it
        will remain usable.

  - If another software is resident
    The FAT16 driver resides on the memory bank 3F00h~3FFFh and the
    function routines 67h and 68h on a page indicated by the contain of F2D0h.
    MSXCDEX (by Taro) can be used with the FAT16 driver because it does not
    use these addresses. This is not the case of Luna (by Tsuyoshi).
    
  - Long file names are not supported.
    DEL command on the MSX-DOS 2 can not erase files with long names.
    Even if you delete all files with a long file name in a folder, it will
    no longer be possible to delete that folder.
    To erase files with a long name, please use "Long File Name Killer" (by
    Tatsu) or an OS that can do it.
     
    To display the full long name of files with long names you can use the
    LDIR command (by Tatsu).
  - Commands that handle FAT of the CHKDSK or UNDEL type are not usable.
    Do not try to use them on a FAT16 disk.
  - If you copy a large number of files (such as 100 files) at a time,
    this will fail in 85% of cases.

8. Version history

[ver0.12]

 - Fixed bugs that occurred when using the external command XCOPY of MSX-DOS 2.
   (Found by KonamiMan.)
 
 - When using XCOPY the bits 16~23 of sector number folders are saved at
   FIB+38h which is a reserved area. This zone is supposed not to be used.
   Therefore, the operation will not always be guaranteed.
   
[ver0.11]

 - Fixed a bug (found by KonamiMan) in the display of folders.

[ver0.10]

 - Fixed a bug when using Ramdisk under MSX-DOS 2.20.

[ver0.09]

 - I replaced the FAT16 recognition method with the string 'FAT16' written
   from the root folder to the boot sector to be compatible with FAT12
   formatted disks for other devices as well. Does not support boot sectors
   without the string 'FAT16'.
   
 - Changing the parameters

[ver0.08]

 - I made sure that the information reserved on the FAT will remain when
   deleting a file or folder on a disk other than DOS2. For example, if
   UNDEL.COM command for FAT16 is expanded in the future, you will be able
   to restore deleted files.
 
 - The UNDEL activation flag is written to boot sector +10 when a file or
   folder is deleted on a non-DOS2 disk.
   UNDEL.COM can not be used for the FAT16 disk but you can delete files on
   a DOS1 disk with the FAT16 driver installed. (They can be restored with
   UNDEL.COM later by removing the FAT16 driver).
    
 - Abandoning my DSKIO routine for MEGA-SCSI.
   When reading FAT in the dedicated buffer with the 1Bh function, C9h is
   written in the Hook of interrupt 0038h. Even though interrupts are allowed,
   they no longer interfere with the DSKIO routine.
   
 - Added option to display FAT types for each player (although it's easy to
   see by looking at the size of the disks).
   The message "not ready" will be displayed for floppy disk drives.

 - Change the address where the driver is placed. The 14h and 15h functions
   are now usable.

 - The display of the 31h function parameters has become compatible with
   FAT16 disks.
 
 - The FAT16 partitions of the MEGA-SCSI can be changed with CP16.COM.

 - The FAT16 driver works with the ATA-IDE interface from BIOS 2.00 or higher.
