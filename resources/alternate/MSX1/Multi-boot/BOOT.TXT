 BOOT.BAS is a BASIC program to manually select the file manager or other
 program you want to run at startup according to your choice.

 You can set up to 10 programs. The layout is automatic.
 It adapts to your generation of MSX and the current width of the screen.
 MSX1-compatible programs only can be configured not to appear when the
 disc boots on MSX. BOOT.BAS is compatible with DOS1, DOS2 and Nextor.

 You just have to modify the DATA lines at the bottom of the program before
 the "380 DATA 255 ,," line to add or delete an element.
 The value after the DATA instruction must be 0 for programs MSX1 only,
 1 for MSX2 or newer.

 The selection is made on the keyboard with the keys from 0 to 9,
 the cursor and space/return keys, or the joystick.
